              Vallensons’ Brewing Company was created from the inspiration and
              passion of Valle Kauniste. His love for craft beer started when he
              was in the United States Air Force where he was fortunate to
              travel the world and taste beers from all over. After leaving the
              military in the early 1990s, he started experimenting with a
              homebrew kit working with different ingredients to create a
              variety of his favorite beers. Throughout the years, he perfected
              his craft resulting in many great beers including one of
              Vallensons' flagships, the Settlers' Oatmeal Stout. Eventually,
              Valle’s passion grew to the point where he wanted to share his
              passion with the community, which led Valle and his wife, Lori, to
              opening Vallensons' Brewing Company in Pearland, Texas.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              On May 27th, 2017, their vision to open their own brewery became a
              reality. On that day, Vallensons’ Brewing Company became a family
              oriented and pet-friendly establishment in the heart of the
              Pearland, Texas community. Vallensons’ provides an assortment of
              beers, ciders, and wines. Vallensons' Brewing Company is a place
              to come and enjoy great beer, good food, provided by food trucks,
              and the occasional live music and entertainment.

              Vallensons’ Brewing Company was envisioned by Valle Kauniste and
              embraced by and, through much feedback over the years, enhanced by
              his wife Lori and other family members as well as many dear
              friends. The Vallensons’ (pronounced Val-N-sons) name was created
              based on the Brewmaster himself and his two sons with hopes and
              dreams of his sons, Valle and Konner, later working with dad at
              the brewery.

              It all started about 17 years ago when Valle decided to experiment
              with crafting his own beer out of his garage. He was originally
              driven by his desire to have better craft beer options that didn’t
              exist at the time. His hobby continued to grow and improve over
              the years-earning him a 1st place medal in a national competition
              for his Oatmeal Stout. Crafting beer has truly become his passion
              in life. He has always enjoyed great satisfaction from sharing his
              craft beers with friends and family and for the past several years
              has dreamed of sharing his craft beers with everyone within his
              reach! After years and years of dreaming and discussing his
              vision, he finally decided to go for it!

              In late 2014, he and his wife began searching for land intended
              for the future home of Vallensons’ Brewing Company. Finally in
              June 2015, they purchased a little over an acre of land in their
              hometown of Pearland, Texas. During this same month, Vallensons’
              had a public hearing with the City of Pearland to approve a
              conditional use permit for the Vallensons’ site. They were truly
              blessed to have several of their closest friends and family show
              their support by attending the public hearing. Jumping ahead and
              past several months of required steps along the way, Vallensons’
              construction finally broke ground on June 21, 2016!!
